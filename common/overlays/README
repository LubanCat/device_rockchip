Overlay dirs
============

1. The common/ would be automatically installed into the images.

2. The rootfs/*/ would be automatically installed into the rootfs.

3. The <OS>/ would be automatically installed into the related OS's rootfs.

4. Set RK_ROOTFS_EXTRA_OVERLAY_DIRS for custom overlay dirs.

5. Unset RK_ROOTFS_OVERLAY_DIRS to disable overlays.

If there's an install.sh under the overlay dir, it would be executed instead of
the default rsync installing.
